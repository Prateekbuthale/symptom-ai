# Medicheck: AI Symptom Checker & Education Partner

An AI-powered digital health assistant that analyzes user-reported symptoms, predicts probable conditions, and offers educational health guidance. Designed for user self-awareness—not diagnosis—Medicheck leverages modern LLMs to bridge the gap between patient-initiated care and professional medical advice.

---

## 🎯 Overview

Medicheck is a web application where users describe their symptoms in plain language and receive:

- Probable conditions (with educational, non-diagnostic explanations)
- AI-generated next steps & recommendations
- Automatic safety disclaimers in every response

The system uses state-of-the-art language models to synthesize patient descriptions, reason about possible causes, and suggest safe, helpful next steps—all while never replacing the need for a doctor.

---

## ✨ Features

- **Natural Language Symptom Input**: Type symptoms as you would to a doctor
- **LLM-Powered Understanding**: Groq’s LLM (e.g., Llama-3) translates user input into probable causes and next actions
- **Educated Recommendations**: Not prescriptive, always educational and backed by disclaimers
- **Session Management**: Tracks multiple symptom-check sessions per user for history and review
- **Front-end Experience**: Modern, mobile-friendly chat and results interface (React/Vite)
- **Secure and Private**: No data is shared; sessions stored for user history only
- **Account System**: Sign up for personalized sessions

---

## 🏗️ Architecture

**System Components**

```
Client (React/Vite)
│  - Chat interface (symptom entry, results)
│  - User account/session management
│
└──▶ Backend API (Node/Express)
    │  - Endpoints for chat, history
    │  - LLM query logic
    │  - User and session storage (Supabase/Postgres)
    │
    └──▶ LLM Client
          - Connects to Groq API (Llama-3 model)
```

**Design Principles**

- **Pure Agentic Health AI**: All reasoning, education, and suggestions are generated by the LLM—no static rules or diagnoses
- **Strict Disclaimers**: Every “result” is wrapped in safety language to prevent misuse
- **Modular Stack**: Swap LLM or storage backend with ease

---

## ⚙️ Key Design Decisions

**1. 100% AI Reasoning (No rule-based logic)**

- Decision: All symptom interpretation and recommendations are LLM-driven
- Why: Ensures flexible, up-to-date, and “human-like” interactive experiences

**2. Session-based Results with User Review**

- Track full chat and result history for every user session
- Meets requirements for persistence & UX clarity

**3. Emphasis on Safety & Education**

- LLM prompts always require a disclaimer and educational framing
- Never make direct recommendations or diagnoses

**4. Multi-session Support**

- Users can review current and past self-checks, supporting repeated exploratory usage

**5. Modern Frontend UX**

- Built with Vite + React for high performance and clean, mobile-friendly display

## 🚀 Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- Postgres/Supabase (for persistent history)
- Groq API key (https://console.groq.com/)

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd Healthcare-Symptom-Checker
```

### 2. Backend Setup

```bash
cd symptom-backend
npm install

# Configure environment:

# Add your Groq API key, DB credentials, etc. in .env


npm start   # Starts server on http://localhost:5003
```

### 3. Frontend Setup

```bash
cd ../symptom-frontend
npm install

# Configure backend URL (.env):
# add "VITE_BACKEND_BASEURL=http://localhost:5003" to .env

npm run dev   # Open http://localhost:5173
```


## 🎮 Usage

1. `/login` or `/signup` and start a new session.
2. Enter symptoms in the chat (e.g., “sore throat, high fever, chills”).
3. The AI will ask follow-up questions if needed.
4. Receive a final results card:
   - **Possible conditions** (not a diagnosis)
   - **Next-step guidance** (e.g., “monitor for worsening, consult doctor”)
   - **Clear disclaimer** on every response.
5. Review all past results in the “All Results” page.
